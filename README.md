# Credit Card Application Processing 
The project aims to help a fictitious bank in providing the convenient system for the processing of credit card applications. A customer uses the system to choose a suitable card among the offerings, and submits the application. The application then moves to the queue of the approver, who is a bank employee. Upon considering various aspects such as credit score, annual income, the approver either approves or rejects the application. Once approved, the application then moves to the queue of the issuer, also a bank employee. Here the card is duly printed and dispatched to the user.
